# EquaGrapher

## EquaGrapher: A Polynomial Function Graphing Tool

**EquaGrapher** is an advanced graphical tool designed to plot polynomial functions of various degrees (1st, 2nd, and 3rd-degree functions). It provides a comprehensive visualization of important characteristics such as roots, extrema (maximum and minimum points), turning points, derivatives, and integrals.

### Features:
- Plot up to 4 polynomial functions simultaneously.
- Adjustable graphing range for better zooming and scaling.
- Visualize key function characteristics, including:
  - Roots (x-intercepts)
  - Extrema (maximum and minimum points)
  - Turning points
  - Derivatives and integral values
- Export graphs as PNG images.
- Save function details and results in a CSV file.

### Installation:
1. Ensure you have **Python 3.6+** installed.
2. Install the required libraries using the command below:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Install PyQt5, as this is a PyQt5-based project:

    ```
    pip install PyQt5
    ```

## How to Run: 
1. Clone this repository:
    ``` git clone https://github.com/username/EquaGrapher.git ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```cd EquaGrapher```
3. Run the application:
    ```python main.py```
## Usage

- Graph Functions: Enter the coefficients for up to 4 polynomial functions (1st, 2nd, or 3rd-degree) in the respective input fields.
- Graph Adjustment: Modify the x-axis and y-axis ranges to zoom in or out on specific parts of the graph.
- Save Graph: Use the export option to save your graph as a PNG file.
- Save Data: Save function results in a CSV file for later use.

## Dependecies:
- Python 3.6+
- PyQt5
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
